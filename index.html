        <h2>What is mental health</h2>
        <p>
            According to WHO, there is no single 'official' definition of mental health. Mental health refers to a
            person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; it influences what they feel and how they think,
            and behave. The state of cognitive and behavioural well-being is referred to as mental health. The term
            'mental health' is also used to refer to the absence of mental disease.<br><br>Mental health means keeping
            our minds healthy. Mankind generally is more focused on keeping their physical body healthy. People tend to
            ignore the state of their minds. Human superiority over other animals lies in his superior mind. Man has
            been able to control life due to his highly developed brain.So, it becomes very important for a man to keep
            both his body and mind fit and healthy. Both physical and mental health are equally important for better
            performance and results.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance Of mental health</h2>
        <p>
            An emotionally fit and stable person always feels vibrant and truly alive and can easily manage emotionally
            difficult situations. To be emotionally strong, one has to be physically fit too. Although mental health is
            a personal issue, what affects one person may or may not affect another; yet, several key elements lead to
            mental health issues.<br><br>
            Many emotional factors have a significant effect on our fitness level like depression, aggression, negative
            thinking, frustration, and fear, etc. A physically fit person is always in a good mood and can easily cope
            up with situations of distress and depression resulting in regular training contributing to a good physical
            fitness standard.<br><br>Mental fitness implies a state of psychological well-being. It denotes having a
            positive sense of how we
            feel, think, and act, which improves one's ability to enjoy life. It contributes to one's inner ability to
            be self-determined. It is a proactive, positive term and forsakes negative thoughts that may come to mind.
            The term mental fitness is increasingly being used by psychologists, mental health practitioners, schools,
            organisations, and the general population to denote logical thinking, clear comprehension, and reasoning
            ability.
